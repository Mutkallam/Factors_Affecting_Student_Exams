# Analyzing Factors That Affect Student Exam Performance
## Tools: Quarto, R, ggplot2, dplyr, corrplot, AIC modeling

In this project, I explored the Student Performance Factors dataset from Kaggle, analyzing how various behavioral, social, and academic factors influence student exam outcomes.

### Key Steps:
Dataset Overview: Worked with a detailed dataset of 6,600+ students, including 20 attributes like hours studied, attendance, parental involvement, tutoring, family income, motivation, and more.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Computed a correlation matrix for numeric variables, identifying top positive predictors like hours studied, attendance, and previous scores.

Used side-by-side boxplots to examine categorical variable effects (e.g., parental involvement, access to resources, extracurricular activities).

Visualized patterns such as the rise in average exam scores with increasing tutoring sessions and resource access distribution using pie charts.

### Methodology:
Model Selection with AIC: Applied stepwise regression using Akaikeâ€™s Information Criterion (AIC) to identify the most impactful predictors on exam scores.

### Key Takeaways:

Top influential factors included access to resources, parental involvement, family income, peer influence, and motivation level.

Some variables such as sleep hours, school type, and gender were excluded due to lack of statistical significance.

Clear insight: both environmental and personal effort factors combine to shape exam performance.

Multifaceted factors drive performance: Socioeconomic and behavioral attributes jointly influence student success, not just academic habits.

Enhanced R skills: Gained practical experience with Quarto reports, statistical modeling, EDA visualizations, and regression analysis using real educational data.
